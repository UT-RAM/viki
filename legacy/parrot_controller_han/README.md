# ram_ba_package

**NB** This is an edited version of the parrot_controller AeroWorks package. Since documentation is not yet present, it is kept in a separate folder.

This package implements a PD controller for setpoint control of a Parrot AR.Drone in indoor scenarios where position information is available. The package is optimized for and aids the user in the connection to multiple drones simultaneously.

All documentation can be found in the `doc` folder. Start at the [root file](doc/root.md).

Have fun!
