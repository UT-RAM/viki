Connection between the HTML GUI and Python backend was established using work by David Baird following his tutorial on http://www.aclevername.com/articles/python-webgui/

Thank you for letting us use your great work, David.

This work has been funded by the European Commission's H2020 project AEROWORKS under grant no. 644128
