Contributing
============

So, you're probably here because you want to contribute to VIKI. That's great! We love the open-source community and
are looking for people that want to make VIKI great, just as we do.

We follow the git branching model as described here http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/. If you
already know how to work with it and want to contribute quickly. There is a quick contributing.md available in the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/UT-RAM/viki/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_.
