User's documentation
====================

Hi there VIKI user.

We have selected some documents that might be of use to you. They are all focussed on using VIKI. There's no information on writing your own stuff (:ref:`contributing`) or even :ref:`developing`. For those purposes there is another documentation.

#. :ref:`installation` - Get VIKI installed correctly on your system
#. :ref:`quickstart` - Start your very own turtle-simulator and control it!
#. :ref:`features` - An overview of things VIKI can do for you
