User documentation
==================

Hi there VIKI user!

This part of the documentation is focused on the using VIKI itself, not on developing modules or contributing to VIKI itself.
Are you looking to write a module? Look at :ref:`contributor`.
Are you looking for internal documentation on VIKI? Look at :ref:`developer`.

This documentation will guide you through the main process of using the GUI and launching your first applications.
