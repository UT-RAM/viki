Contributor documentation
=========================

Hi there VIKI-contributor. 

This part of the documentation is aimed at people writing their own modules. If you just want to use viki, take a look at :ref:`user`, or if you're interested in internal documentation, have a look at :ref:`developer`.

As you probably already know, VIKI modules provide the core functionality of VIKI. They are an abstraction layer on top of ROS packages, allowing for easy use of them using default settings, easy linking through the gui and, perhaps most importantly, easy composition of different ROS packages. The :ref:`modtutorial` will introduce you into the basic concept. After that, you can get more in-depth on the other topics.
