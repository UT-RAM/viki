Module repositories
===================

It is important to grasp the concept of module repositories. VIKI recursively scans its module folder, allowing us to put multiple repositories in that folder. By default, the core VIKI modules are located in *viki_modules/core*. If you would easily like to add your own specific modules, you can create a subfolder next to the core folder, such as *viki_modules/drone_modules*, in which you place your own modules.
