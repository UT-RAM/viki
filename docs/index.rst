   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to AeroWorks's documentation!
=====================================

This documentation consists of two parts:

#. A :ref:`userguide`
#. An :ref:`apidoc`

.. _`API documentation`: :ref:`apidoc`
.. _`user guide`: :ref:

The page you are seeing now is auto-generated using sphinx. If you have sphinx you can update the documentation by running the following line in the root of the project.

.. code-block:: bash

      sphinx-apidoc -f -o docs core; cd docs; make html; cd ..

The developers will also update the documentation in the repository when important changes are done. In that case just updating your repository to the latest version is sufficient.
