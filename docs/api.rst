API documentation
=================

For JavaScript (front end):
Automatic API generation is not possible. The JavaScript is written self-explanatory as much as possible, commented where needed. In the future further documentation will be provided.

For Python (back end). This is automatically generated from the docstrings:

* :ref:`genindex`
* :ref:`modindex`
* :ref:`search`
